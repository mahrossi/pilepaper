abstract = {Surprisingly, there exists a quantum flux-side time-correlation function which has a non-zero t → 0+ limit and thus yields a rigorous quantum generalization of classical transition-state theory (TST). In this Part I of two articles, we introduce the new time-correlation function and derive its t → 0+ limit. The new ingredient is a generalized Kubo transform which allows the flux and side dividing surfaces to be the same function of path-integral space. Choosing this function to be a single point gives a t → 0+ limit which is identical to an expression introduced on heuristic grounds by Wigner in 1932; however, this expression does not give positive-definite quantum statistics, causing it to fail while still in the shallow-tunnelling regime. Positive-definite quantum statistics is obtained only if the dividing surface is invariant to imaginary-time translation, in which case the t → 0+ limit is identical to ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) TST. The RPMD-TST rate is not a strict upper bound to the exact quantum rate, but is a good approximation to one if real-time coherence effects are small. Part II will show that the RPMD-TST rate is equal to the exact quantum rate in the absence of recrossing.},

@article{rich-alth09jcp,
abstract = {We demonstrate that the ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) method is equivalent to an automated and approximate implementation of the "Im F" version of semiclassical instanton theory when used to calculate reaction rates in the deep-tunneling regime. This explains why the RPMD method is often reliable in this regime and also shows how it can be systematically improved. The geometry of the beads at the transition state on the ring-polymer potential surface describes a finite-difference approximation to the "instanton" trajectory (a periodic orbit in imaginary time beta variant Planck's over 2pi on the inverted potential surface). The deep-tunneling RPMD rate is an approximation to the rate obtained by applying classical transition-state theory (TST) in ring-polymer phase-space using the optimal dividing surface; this TST rate is in turn an approximation to a free-energy version of the Im F instanton rate. The optimal dividing surface is in general a function of several modes of the ring polymer, which explains why centroid-based quantum-TSTs break down at low temperatures for asymmetric reaction barriers. Numerical tests on one-dimensional models show that the RPMD rate tends to overestimate deep-tunneling rates for asymmetric barriers and underestimate them for symmetric barriers, and we explain that this is likely to be a general trend. The ability of the RPMD method to give a dividing-surface-independent rate in the deep-tunneling regime is shown to be a consequence of setting the bead-masses equal to the physical mass.},

abstract = {The quantum nature of nuclei plays an important role in the accurate modelling of light atoms such as hydrogen, but it is often neglected in simulations due to the high computational overhead involved. It has recently been shown that zero-point energy effects can be included comparatively cheaply in simulations of harmonic and quasiharmonic systems by augmenting classical molecular dynamics with a generalized Langevin equation (GLE). Here we describe how a similar approach can be used to accelerate the convergence of path integral (PI) molecular dynamics to the exact quantum mechanical result in more strongly anharmonic systems exhibiting both zero point energy and tunnelling effects. The resulting PI-GLE method is illustrated with applications to a double-well tunnelling problem and to liquid water.},

abstract = {The motion of the excess proton is understood as a process involving interconversion between two limiting states, namely, the Eigen and Zundel cations. Nuclear quantum effects (NQE) and the organization of the surrounding solvent play a significant role in this process. However, little is known about how these factors can change the limiting state in molecular systems and the physicochemical properties of its surrounding hydrogen-bond environment. In this work we use state of the art ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to examine the role of NQE on the nature of the proton in four hydrogen chloride hydrates. We demonstrate that NQE significantly alter the phase space properties of the proton and that the local electronic structure of the proton is an exquisitely sensitive indicator of the limiting state in each of the crystals. We evaluate both the proton momentum distribution and the proton chemical shifts and demonstrate that deep inelastic neutron scattering and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments can serve as complementary techniques for probing the quantum nature of the proton in hydrogen-bonding systems. We believe that the rich and insightful information we obtain for these acid hydrates provides a motivation for new experimental studies.},

The local structure is characterized by comparison with bulk and surface of ordinary hexagonal ice Ih and with calculated spectra. Most molecules in liquid water are in two hydrogen-bonded configurations with one strong donor and one strong acceptor hydrogen bond in contrast to the four hydrogen-bonded tetrahedral structure in ice. Upon heating from 25 degrees C to 90 degrees C, 5 to 10\% of the molecules change from tetrahedral environments to two hydrogen-bonded configurations. Our findings are consistent with neutron and x-ray diffraction data, and combining the results sets a strong limit for possible local structure distributions in liquid water.

abstract = {Numerous studies have identified large quantum mechanical effects in the dynamics of liquid water. In this paper, we suggest that these effects may have been overestimated due to the use of rigid water models and flexible models in which the intramolecular interactions were described using simple harmonic functions. To demonstrate this, we introduce a new simple point charge model for liquid water, q-TIP4P/F, in which the O-H stretches are described by Morse-type functions. We have parametrized this model to give the correct liquid structure, diffusion coefficient, and infrared absorption frequencies in quantum (path integral-based) simulations. The model also reproduces the experimental temperature variation of the liquid density and affords reasonable agreement with the experimental melting temperature of hexagonal ice at atmospheric pressure. By comparing classical and quantum simulations of the liquid, we find that quantum mechanical fluctuations increase the rates of translational diffusion and orientational relaxation in our model by a factor of around 1.15. This effect is much smaller than that observed in all previous simulations of empirical water models, which have found a quantum effect of at least 1.4 regardless of the quantum simulation method or the water model employed. The small quantum effect in our model is a result of two competing phenomena. Intermolecular zero point energy and tunneling effects destabilize the hydrogen-bonding network, leading to a less viscous liquid with a larger diffusion coefficient. However, this is offset by intramolecular zero point motion, which changes the average water monomer geometry resulting in a larger dipole moment, stronger intermolecular interactions, and a slower diffusion. We end by suggesting, on the basis of simulations of other potential energy models, that the small quantum effect we find in the diffusion coefficient is associated with the ability of our model to produce a single broad O-H stretching band in the infrared absorption spectrum.},

abstract = {The important role of liquid water in many areas of science from chemistry, physics, biology, geology to climate research, etc., has motivated numerous theoretical studies of its structure and dynamics. The significance of quantum effects on the properties of water, however, has not yet been fully resolved. In this paper we focus on quantum dynamical effects in liquid water based on the linearized semiclassical initial value representation (LSC-IVR) with a quantum version of the simple point charge/flexible (q-SPC/fw) model [Paesani et al., J. Chem. Phys. 125, 184507 (2006)] for the potential energy function. The infrared (IR) absorption spectrum and the translational diffusion constants have been obtained from the corresponding thermal correlation functions, and the effects of intermolecular and intramolecular correlations have been studied. The LSC-IVR simulation results are compared with those predicted by the centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) approach. Although the LSC-IVR and CMD results agree well for the broadband for hindered motions in liquid water, the intramolecular bending and O-H stretching peaks predicted by the LSC-IVR are blueshifted from those given by CMD; reasons for this are discussed. We also suggest that the broadband in the IR spectrum corresponding to restricted translation and libration gives more information than the diffusion constant on the nature of quantum effects on translational and rotational motions and should thus receive more attention in this regard.},

abstract = {A new scheme, sketch-map, for obtaining a low-dimensional representation of the region of phase space explored during an enhanced dynamics simulation is proposed. We show evidence, from an examination of the distribution of pairwise distances between frames, that some features of the free-energy surface are inherently high-dimensional. This makes dimensionality reduction problematic because the data does not satisfy the assumptions made in conventional manifold learning algorithms We therefore propose that when dimensionality reduction is performed on trajectory data one should think of the resultant embedding as a quickly sketched set of directions rather than a road map. In other words, the embedding tells one about the connectivity between states but does not provide the vectors that correspond to the slow degrees of freedom. This realization informs the development of sketch-map, which endeavors to reproduce the proximity information from the high-dimensionality description in a space of lower dimensionality even when a faithful embedding is not possible.},

abstract = {The dissociation of a water molecule in liquid water is the fundamental event in acid-base chemistry, determining the pH of water. Because of the short time scales and microscopic length scales involved, the dynamics of this autoionization have not been directly probed by experiment. Here, the autoionization mechanism is revealed by sampling and analyzing ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories. We identify the rare fluctuations in solvation energies that destabilize an oxygen-hydrogen bond. Through the transfer of protons along a hydrogen bond "wire," the nascent ions separate by three or more neighbors. If the hydrogen bond wire connecting the two ions is subsequently broken, a metastable charge-separated state is visited. The ions may then diffuse to large separations. If, however, the hydrogen bond wire remains unbroken, the ions recombine rapidly. Because of their concomitant large electric fields, the transient ionic species produced in this case may provide an experimentally detectable signal of the dynamics we report.},

Crystal structure can only be predicted effectively with quantum mechanics if an algorithm to direct the search through the large space of possible structures is found.

abstract = {The thermal Gaussian approximation (TGA) recently developed by Frantsuzov et al. [Chem. Phys. Lett. 381, 117 (2003)] has been demonstrated to be a practical way for approximating the Boltzmann operator exp(-betaH) for multidimensional systems. In this paper the TGA is combined with semiclassical (SC) initial value representations (IVRs) for thermal time correlation functions. Specifically, it is used with the linearized SC-IVR (LSC-IVR, equivalent to the classical Wigner model), and the "forward-backward semiclassical dynamics" approximation developed by Shao and Makri [J. Phys. Chem. A 103, 7753 (1999); 103, 9749 (1999)]. Use of the TGA with both of these approximate SC-IVRs allows the oscillatory part of the IVR to be integrated out explicitly, providing an extremely simple result that is readily applicable to large molecular systems. Calculation of the force-force autocorrelation for a strongly anharmonic oscillator demonstrates its accuracy, and calculation of the velocity autocorrelation function (and thus the diffusion coefficient) of liquid neon demonstrates its applicability.},

abstract = {We describe a complete set of algorithms for ab initio molecular simulations based on numerically tabulated atom-centered orbitals (NAOs) to capture a wide range of molecular and materials properties from quantum-mechanical first principles. The full algorithmic framework described here is embodied in the Fritz Haber Institute "ab initio molecular simulations" (FHI-aims) computer program package. Its comprehensive description should be relevant to any other first-principles implementation based on NAOs. The focus here is on density-functional theory (DFT) in the local and semilocal (generalized gradient) approximations, but an extension to hybrid functionals, Hartree-Fock theory, and MP2/GW electron self-energies for total energies and excited states is possible within the same underlying algorithms. An all-electron/full-potential treatment that is both computationally efficient and accurate is achieved for periodic and cluster geometries on equal footing, including relaxation and ab initio molecular dynamics. We demonstrate the construction of transferable, hierarchical basis sets, allowing the calculation to range from qualitative tight-binding like accuracy to meV-level total energy convergence with the basis set. Since all basis functions are strictly localized, the otherwise computationally dominant grid-based operations scale as O(N) with system size N. Together with a scalar-relativistic treatment, the basis sets provide access to all elements from light to heavy. Both low-communication parallelization of all real-space grid based algorithms and a ScaLapack-based, customized handling of the linear algebra for all matrix operations are possible, guaranteeing efficient scaling (CPU time and memory) up to massively parallel computer systems with thousands of CPUs.},

abstract = {In the last decade, ab initio simulations and especially Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics have significantly contributed to the improvement of our understanding of both the physical and chemical properties of water, ice, and hydrogen-bonded systems in general. At the heart of this family of in silico techniques lies the crucial idea of computing the many-body interactions by solving the electronic structure problem "on the fly" as the simulation proceeds, which circumvents the need for pre-parameterized potential models. In particular, the field of proton transfer in hydrogen-bonded networks greatly benefits from these technical advances. Here, several systems of seemingly quite different nature and of increasing complexity, such as Grotthuss diffusion in water, excited-state proton-transfer in solution, phase transitions in ice, and protonated water networks in the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin, are discussed in the realms of a unifying viewpoint.},

Our approach can easily be applied to any type of pseudopotential, and also has the advantage that it can be used to obtain estimates of the atomic forces that would arise if the real atoms were present, thus giving insight into the expected displacements in the real alloy. We have applied this VCA technique within the Vanderbilt ultrasoft-pseudopotential scheme to predict dielectric and piezoelectric properties of the Pb(Zr0.5Ti0.5)O-3 solid solution in its paraelectric and ferroelectric phases, respectively. Comparison with calculations performed on ordered alloy supercells and with data on parents compounds demonstrates the adequacy of using the VCA for this perovskite solid solution. In particular, the VCA approach reproduces the anomalous Born effective charges and the large value of the piezoelectric coefficients.},

abstract = {We examine the short-time accuracy of a class of approximate quantum dynamical techniques that includes the centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) and ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) methods. Both of these methods are based on the path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) technique for calculating the exact static equilibrium properties of quantum mechanical systems. For Kubo-transformed real-time correlation functions involving operators that are linear functions of positions or momenta, the RPMD and (adiabatic) CMD approximations differ only in the choice of the artificial mass matrix of the system of ring polymer beads that is employed in PIMD. The obvious ansatz for a general method of this type is therefore to regard the elements of the PIMD (or Parrinello-Rahman) mass matrix as an adjustable set of parameters that can be chosen to improve the accuracy of the resulting approximation. We show here that this ansatz leads uniquely to the RPMD approximation when the criterion that is used to select the mass matrix is the short-time accuracy of the Kubo-transformed correlation function. In particular, we show that the leading error in the RPMD position autocorrelation function is O(t(8)) and the error in the velocity autocorrelation function is O(t(6)), for a general anharmonic potential. The corresponding errors in the CMD approximation are O(t(6)) and O(t(4)), respectively.},

The rigid-body centroid molecular dynamics method employed allows for the investigation of equilibrium and dynamical properties of the quantum system. The impact of quantization on the local structure, as measured by the radial and spatial distribution functions, as well as the energy is presented. The effects of quantization on the lattice vibrations, associated with the molecular translations and librations, are also reported. Comparison of quantum and classical simulation results indicates that shifts in the average potential energy are equivalent to rising the temperature about 80 K and are therefore non-negligible. The energy shifts due to quantization and the quantum mechanical uncertainties observed in ice are smaller than the values previously reported for liquid water. Additionally, we carry out a comparative study of melting in our classical and quantum simulations and show that there are significant differences between classical and quantum ice.},

We observe that already in the second excited state of the O-H stretch vibration, the hydrogen atom becomes delocalized between the oxygen atoms of two neighboring water molecules. The energy required for this delocalization is unexpectedly low and corresponds to less than 20\% of the dissociation energy of the O-H bond of the water molecule in the gas phase.},

abstract = {A quantum simulation of an imaginary time path integral typically requires around n times more computational effort than the corresponding classical simulation, where n is the number of ring polymer beads (or imaginary time slices) used in the calculation. However, this estimate neglects the fact that the potential energies of many systems can be decomposed into a sum of rapidly varying short-range and slowly varying long-range contributions. For such systems, the computational effort of the path integral simulation can be reduced considerably by evaluating the long-range forces on a contracted ring polymer with fewer beads than are needed to evaluate the short-range forces. This idea is developed and then illustrated with an application to a flexible model of liquid water in which the intramolecular forces are evaluated with 32 beads, the oxygen-oxygen Lennard-Jones forces with seven, and the intermolecular electrostatic forces with just five. The resulting static and dynamic properties are within a few percent of those of a full 32-bead calculation, and yet they are obtained with a computational effort less than six times (rather than 32 times) that of a classical simulation. We hope that this development will encourage future studies of quantum mechanical fluctuations in liquid water and aqueous solutions and in many other systems with similar interaction potentials.},

Such processes are quantitatively analysed and their dependence on the initial kinetic energy and on the impinging direction is discussed. A clear influence of the surface anisotropy on both steering and transient mobility effects is revealed by our simulations for the simple isolated-atom case and in the submonolayer-growth regime. For the latter case, we illustrate how steering and transient mobility affect the film morphology at the nanoscale.},

Quantum effects on nuclear motion have been included through a quantum thermal bath (QTB). The interatomic forces were described either within the density functional theory (DFT) in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) or by the phenomenological approach using the shell model. For both models, the isotopic shift in the lattice parameter can be successfully predicted by QTB-MD simulations. The slope of the experimental isotopic shift in pressure is satisfactorily reproduced by QTB-MD within DFT-GGA, in contrast to both density functional perturbation theory and QTB-MD with the shell model. We have analyzed the reasons for these discrepancies through the vibrational densities of states and the isotopic shifts in bulk modulus. The results illustrate the importance of anharmonic contributions to vibrations and to the isotopic pressure shift between LiH and LiD.},

abstract = {As an application of atomistic simulation methods to heat capacities, path-integral molecular dynamics has been used to calculate the constant-volume heat capacities of light and heavy water in the gas, liquid, and solid phases. While the classical simulation based on conventional molecular dynamics has estimated the heat capacities too high, the quantum simulation based on path-integral molecular dynamics has given reasonable results based on the simple point-charge/flexible potential model. The calculated heat capacities (divided by the Boltzmann constant) in the quantum simulation are 3.1 in the vapor H2O at 300 K, 6.9 in the liquid H2O at 300 K, and 4.1 in the ice Ih H2O at 250 K, respectively, which are comparable to the experimental data of 3.04, 8.9, and 4.1, respectively. The quantum simulation also reproduces the isotope effect. The heat capacity in the liquid D2O has been calculated to be 10\% higher than that of H2O, while it is 13\% higher in the experiment. The results demonstrate that the path-integral simulation is a promising approach to quantitatively evaluate the heat capacities for molecular systems, taking account of quantum-mechanical vibrations as well as strongly anharmonic motions.},

Here we present new insights into the nature of local interactions in water obtained using a novel energy-decomposition method. Our simulations reveal that although a water molecule forms, on average, two strong donor and two strong acceptor bonds, there is a significant asymmetry in the energy of these contacts. We demonstrate that this asymmetry is a result of small instantaneous distortions of hydrogen bonds, which appear as fluctuations on a time scale of hundreds of femtoseconds around the average symmetric structure. Furthermore, we show that the distinct features of the X-ray absorption spectra originate from molecules with high instantaneous asymmetry. Our findings have important implications as they help reconcile the symmetric and asymmetric views on the structure of water.},

This scheme does not rely on the localization of the orbitals and is insensitive to ill-conditioned Hamiltonians. It lends itself naturally to linear scaling as soon as the sparsity of the system's density matrix is exploited. By using a combination of polynomial expansion and Newton-like iterative techniques, an arbitrarily large number of terms can be employed in the expansion, overcoming some of the difficulties encountered in previous papers. Moreover, this hybrid approach allows us to obtain a very favorable scaling of the computational cost with increasing inverse temperature, which makes the method competitive with other Fermi operator expansion techniques. After performing an in-depth theoretical analysis of computational cost and accuracy, we test our approach on the density functional theory Hamiltonian for the metallic phase of the LiAl alloy.},

Barrierless proton transfer is observed in each case when quantum nuclear effects (QNEs) are accounted for. The key difference between the two systems is that in the nanotube facile PT is facilitated by a favorable pre-alignment of water molecules, whereas in bulk liquid water solvent reorganization is required prior to PT. Configurations where the quantum excess proton is delocalized over several adjacent water molecules along with continuous interconversion between different hydration states reveals that, as in liquid water, the hydrated proton under confinement is best described as a fluxional defect, rather than any individual idealized hydration state such as Zundel, Eigen, or the so-called linear H7O3(+) complex along the water chain. These findings highlight the importance of QNEs in intermediate strength hydrogen bonds (HBs) and explain why H(+) diffusion through nanochannels is impeded much less than other cations.},

abstract = {The path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) method provides a convenient way to compute the quantum mechanical structural and thermodynamic properties of condensed phase systems at the expense of introducing an additional set of high frequency normal modes on top of the physical vibrations of the system. Efficiently sampling such a wide range of frequencies provides a considerable thermostatting challenge. Here we introduce a simple stochastic path integral Langevin equation (PILE) thermostat which exploits an analytic knowledge of the free path integral normal mode frequencies. We also apply a recently developed colored noise thermostat based on a generalized Langevin equation (GLE), which automatically achieves a similar, frequency-optimized sampling. The sampling efficiencies of these thermostats are compared with that of the more conventional Nos\'{e}-Hoover chain (NHC) thermostat for a number of physically relevant properties of the liquid water and hydrogen-in-palladium systems. In nearly every case, the new PILE thermostat is found to perform just as well as the NHC thermostat while allowing for a computationally more efficient implementation. The GLE thermostat also proves to be very robust delivering a near-optimum sampling efficiency in all of the cases considered. We suspect that these simple stochastic thermostats will therefore find useful application in many future PIMD simulations.},

Traditionally, the SIE has been formulated as a one-electron problem, which has been addressed in several recent functionals. However, these recent one-electron SIE-free functionals, while greatly improving the description of thermochemistry and reaction barriers in general, still exhibit many of the difficulties associated with SIE. Thus we emphasize the need to surpass this limit and shed light on the many-electron SIE. After identifying the sufficient condition for functionals to be free from SIE, we focus on the symptoms and investigate the performance of most popular functionals. We show that these functionals suffer from many-electron SIE. Finally, we give a SIE classification of density functionals.},

abstract = {The maximum entropy analytic continuation (MEAC) and ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) methods provide complementary approaches to the calculation of real time quantum correlation functions. RPMD becomes exact in the high temperature limit, where the thermal time betavariant Planck's over 2pi tends to zero and the ring polymer collapses to a single classical bead. MEAC becomes most reliable at low temperatures, where betavariant Planck's over 2pi exceeds the correlation time of interest and the numerical imaginary time correlation function contains essentially all of the information that is needed to recover the real time dynamics. We show here that this situation can be exploited by combining the two methods to give an improved approximation that is better than either of its parts. In particular, the MEAC method provides an ideal way to impose exact moment (or sum rule) constraints on a prior RPMD spectrum. The resulting scheme is shown to provide a practical solution to the "nonlinear operator problem" of RPMD, and to give good agreement with recent exact results for the short-time velocity autocorrelation function of liquid parahydrogen. Moreover these improvements are obtained with little extra effort, because the imaginary time correlation function that is used in the MEAC procedure can be computed at the same time as the RPMD approximation to the real time correlation function. However, there are still some problems involving long-time dynamics for which the RPMD+MEAC combination is inadequate, as we illustrate with an example application to the collective density fluctuations in liquid orthodeuterium.},

This technique is used extensively in fields ranging from physics to genetics and economics. The rejection of trial configurations is a central ingredient in existing Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. I argue that the efficiency of Monte Carlo simulations can be enhanced, sometimes dramatically, by properly sampling configurations that are normally rejected. This "waste-recycling" of microstates is useful in sampling schemes in which only one of a large set of trial configurations is accepted. It differs fundamentally from schemes that extract information about the density of macrostates from virtual Monte Carlo moves. As a simple illustration, I show that the method greatly improves the calculation of the order-parameter distribution of a two-dimensional Ising model. This method should enhance the efficiency of parallel Monte Carlo simulations significantly.},

abstract = {Classical molecular dynamics is a convenient method for computing anharmonic infrared spectra of polyatomic molecules and condensed phase systems. However it does not perform well for predicting accurate intensities and it lacks nuclear quantization, two deficiencies that are usually accounted for by empirical scaling factors. In this paper we show on the examples of the trans isomer of nitrous acid and naphthalene that both issues can be alleviated by preparing the initial conditions according to semiclassical quantization based on a normal mode representation. The method correctly reproduces fundamental frequencies obtained with quantum mechanical methods. At increasing temperatures, the effective frequencies are found to follow the same trends as path-integral based methods. In the low-temperature limit, the band intensities predicted by the method are also found to agree with quantum mechanical considerations.},

@article{grim+10jcp,
abstract = {The method of dispersion correction as an add-on to standard Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT-D) has been refined regarding higher accuracy, broader range of applicability, and less empiricism. The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15\%-40\% compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C(6) coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10\%) weakens the interlayer binding. We propose the revised DFT-D method as a general tool for the computation of the dispersion energy in molecules and solids of any kind with DFT and related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems.},

abstract = {The theory underlying the Car-Parrinello extended-Lagrangian approach to ab initio molecular dynamics (CPMD) is reviewed and reexamined using "heavy" ice as a test system. It is emphasized that the adiabatic decoupling in CPMD is not a decoupling of electronic orbitals from the ions but only a decoupling of a subset of the orbital vibrational modes from the rest of the necessarily coupled system of orbitals and ions. Recent work [J. Chem. Phys. 116, 14 (2002)] has pointed out that, due to the orbital-ion coupling that remains once adiabatic decoupling has been achieved, a large value of the fictitious mass mu can lead to systematic errors in the computed forces in CPMD. These errors are further investigated in the present work with a focus on those parts of these errors that are not corrected simply by rescaling the masses of the ions. It is suggested that any comparison of the efficiencies of Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) and CPMD should be performed at a similar level of accuracy. If accuracy is judged according to the average magnitude of the systematic errors in the computed forces, the efficiency of BOMD compares more favorably to that of CPMD than previous comparisons have suggested.},

abstract = {We have used the ring polymer molecular dynamics method to study the Azzouz-Borgis model for proton transfer between phenol (AH) and trimethylamine (B) in liquid methyl chloride. When the A-H distance is used as the reaction coordinate, the ring polymer trajectories are found to exhibit multiple recrossings of the transition state dividing surface and to give a rate coefficient that is smaller than the quantum transition state theory value by an order of magnitude. This is to be expected on kinematic grounds for a heavy-light-heavy reaction when the light atom transfer coordinate is used as the reaction coordinate, and it clearly precludes the use of transition state theory with this reaction coordinate. As has been shown previously for this problem, a solvent polarization coordinate defined in terms of the expectation value of the proton transfer distance in the ground adiabatic quantum state provides a better reaction coordinate with less recrossing. These results are discussed in light of the wide body of earlier theoretical work on the Azzouz-Borgis model and the considerable range of previously reported values for its proton and deuteron transfer rate coefficients.},

Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.},

abstract = {The centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) method is applied to the study of liquid water in the context of the rigid-body approximation. This rigid-body CMD technique, which is significantly more efficient than the standard CMD method, is implemented on the TIP4P model for water and used to examine isotopic effects in the equilibrium and dynamical properties of liquid H(2)O and D(2)O. The results obtained with this approach compare remarkably well with those determined previously with path integrals simulations as well as those obtained from the standard CMD method employing flexible models. In addition, an examination of the impact of quantization on the rotational and librational motion of the water molecule is also reported.},

abstract = {We first show that a simple scaling of fluctuation coordinates defined in terms of a given reference point gives the conventional virial estimator in discretized path integral, where different choices of the reference point lead to different forms of the estimator (e.g., centroid virial). The merit of this procedure is that it allows a finite-difference evaluation of the virial estimator with respect to temperature, which totally avoids the need of higher-order potential derivatives. We apply this procedure to energy and heat-capacity calculations of the (H(2))(22) and Ne(13) clusters at low temperature using the fourth-order Takahashi-Imada [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 53, 3765 (1984)] and Suzuki [Phys. Lett. A 201, 425 (1995)] propagators. This type of calculation requires up to third-order potential derivatives if analytical virial estimators are used, but in practice only first-order derivatives suffice by virtue of the finite-difference scheme above. From the application to quantum clusters, we find that the fourth-order propagators do improve upon the primitive approximation, and that the choice of the reference point plays a vital role in reducing the variance of the virial estimator.},

abstract = {The mono-, di-, and tetrahydrates of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, which contain characteristic H(3)O(+), H(5)O(2)(+), and H(9)O(4)(+) structures, provide model systems for understanding proton transport in materials with high perfluorosulfonic acid density such as perfluorosulfonic acid membranes commonly employed in hydrogen fuel cells. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations indicate that protons in these solids are predisposed to transfer to the water most strongly bound to sulfonate groups via a Grotthuss-type mechanism, but quickly return to the most solvated defect structure either due to the lack of a nearby species to stabilize the new defect or a preference for the proton to be maximally hydrated. Path integral molecular dynamics of the mono- and dihydrate reveal significant quantum effects that facilitate proton transfer to the "presolvated" water or SO(3)(-) in the first solvation shell and increase the Zundel character of all the defects. These trends are quantified in free energy profiles for each bonding environment. Hydrogen bonding criteria for HOH-OH(2) and HOH-O(3)S are extracted from the two-dimensional potential of mean force. The quantum radial distribution function, radius of gyration, and root-mean-square displacement position correlation function show that the protonic charge is distributed over two or more water molecules. Metastable structural defects with one excess proton shared between two sulfonate groups and another Zundel or Eigen type cation defect are found for the mono- and dihydrate but not for the tetrahydrate crystal. Results for the tetrahydrate native crystal exhibit minor differences at 210 and 250 K. IR spectra are calculated for all native and stable defect structures. Graph theory techniques are used to characterize the chain lengths and ring sizes in the hydrogen bond network. Low conductivities when limited water is present may be attributable to trapping of protons between SO(3)(-) groups and the increased probability that protons transfer to waters bridging two different sulfonate groups.},

abstract = {Higher order factorization schemes are developed for path integral molecular dynamics in order to improve the convergence of estimators for physical observables as a function of the Trotter number. The methods are based on the Takahashi-Imada and Susuki decompositions of the Boltzmann operator. The methods introduced improve the averages of the estimators by using the classical forces needed to carry out the dynamics to construct a posteriori weighting factors for standard path integral molecular dynamics. The new approaches are straightforward to implement in existing path integral codes and carry no significant overhead. The Suzuki higher order factorization was also used to improve the end-to-end distance estimator in open path integral molecular dynamics. The new schemes are tested in various model systems, including an ab initio path integral molecular dynamics calculation on the hydrogen molecule and a quantum water model. The proposed algorithms have potential utility for reducing the cost of path integral molecular dynamics calculations of bulk systems.},

abstract = {The recombination of hydronium and hydroxide ions following water ionization is one of the most fundamental processes determining the pH of water. The neutralization step once the solvated ions are in close proximity is phenomenologically understood to be fast, but the molecular mechanism has not been directly probed by experiments. We elucidate the mechanism of recombination in liquid water with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and it emerges as quite different from the conventional view of the Grotthuss mechanism. The neutralization event involves a collective compression of the water-wire bridging the ions, which occurs in approximately 0.5 ps, triggering a concerted triple jump of the protons. This process leaves the neutralized hydroxide in a hypercoordinated state, with the implications that enhanced collective compressions of several water molecules around similarly hypercoordinated states are likely to serve as nucleation events for the autoionization of liquid water.},

abstract = {The self-consistent phonons (SCP) method provides a consistent way to include anharmonic effects when treating a many-body quantum system at thermal equilibrium. The system is then described by an effective temperature-dependent harmonic Hamiltonian, which can be used to estimate the system's properties, such as its free energy or its vibrational spectrum. The numerical bottleneck of the method is the evaluation of Gaussian averages of the potential energy and its derivatives. Several algorithmic ideas/tricks are introduced to reduce the cost of such integration by orders of magnitude, e.g., relative to that of the previous implementation of the SCP approach by Calvo et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 133, 074303 (2010)]. One such algorithmic improvement is the replacement of standard Monte Carlo integration by quasi-Monte Carlo integration utilizing low-discrepancy sequences. The performance of the method is demonstrated on the calculation of vibrational frequencies of pyrene. It is then applied to compute the free energies of five isomers of water hexamer using the WHBB potential of Bowman and co-workers [J. Chem. Phys. 134, 094509 (2011)]. The present results predict the hexamer prism being thermodynamically most stable, with the free energy of the hexamer cage being about 0.2 kcal mol(-1) higher at all temperatures below T = 200 K.},

abstract = {Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions, regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs-30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 10(6) optic nerve fibers-a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

abstract = {When examining complex problems, such as the folding of proteins, coarse grained descriptions of the system drive our investigation and help us to rationalize the results. Oftentimes collective variables (CVs), derived through some chemical intuition about the process of interest, serve this purpose. Because finding these CVs is the most difficult part of any investigation, we recently developed a dimensionality reduction algorithm, sketch-map, that can be used to build a low-dimensional map of a phase space of high-dimensionality. In this paper we discuss how these machine-generated CVs can be used to accelerate the exploration of phase space and to reconstruct free-energy landscapes. To do so, we develop a formalism in which high-dimensional configurations are no longer represented by low-dimensional position vectors. Instead, for each configuration we calculate a probability distribution, which has a domain that encompasses the entirety of the low-dimensional space. To construct a biasing potential, we exploit an analogy with metadynamics and use the trajectory to adaptively construct a repulsive, history-dependent bias from the distributions that correspond to the previously visited configurations. This potential forces the system to explore more of phase space by making it desirable to adopt configurations whose distributions do not overlap with the bias. We apply this algorithm to a small model protein and succeed in reproducing the free-energy surface that we obtain from a parallel tempering calculation.},

abstract = {We have studied diffusion pathways of a silyl radical adsorbed on the hydrogenated Si (100)-(2x1) surface by density-functional theory. The process is of interest for the growth of crystalline silicon by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. Preliminary searches for migration mechanisms have been performed using metadynamics simulations. Local minima and transition states have been further refined by using the nudged-elastic-band method. Barriers for diffusion from plausible adsorption sites as low as 0.2 eV have been found, but trap states have also been spotted, leading to a more stable configuration, with escape barriers of 0.7 eV. Diffusion among weakly bound physisorbed states is also possible with very low activation barriers (<50 meV). However, desorption mechanisms (either as SiH3 or as SiH4) from physisorbed or more strongly bound adsorption configurations turn out to have activation energies similar to diffusion barriers. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations based on ab initio activation energies show that the silyl radical diffuses at most by a few lattice spacing before desorbing at temperatures in the range 300-1000 K.},

This behavior is qualitatively unaffected by a transition at 0.19 GPa to a new phase Ag3[Co(CN)6]-II, whose structure is reported here. The high-pressure phase also shows anisotropic thermal expansion with large uniaxial negative thermal expansion (NTE, expansion on cooling). In both phases, the NLC/NTE effect arises as the rapid compression/contraction of layers of silver atoms\{---\}weakly bound via argentophilic interactions\{---\}is translated via flexing of the covalent network lattice into an expansion along a perpendicular direction. It is proposed that framework materials that contract along a specific direction on heating while expanding macroscopically will, in general, also expand along the same direction under hydrostatic pressure while contracting macroscopically.},

abstract = {The shift in chemical equilibria due to isotope substitution is frequently exploited to obtain insight into a wide variety of chemical and physical processes. It is a purely quantum mechanical effect, which can be computed exactly using simulations based on the path integral formalism. Here we discuss how these techniques can be made dramatically more efficient, and how they ultimately outperform quasi-harmonic approximations to treat quantum liquids not only in terms of accuracy, but also in terms of computational cost. To achieve this goal we introduce path integral quantum mechanics estimators based on free energy perturbation, which enable the evaluation of isotope effects using only a single path integral molecular dynamics trajectory of the naturally abundant isotope. We use as an example the calculation of the free energy change associated with H/D and (16)O/(18)O substitutions in liquid water, and of the fractionation of those isotopes between the liquid and the vapor phase. In doing so, we demonstrate and discuss quantitatively the relative benefits of each approach, thereby providing a set of guidelines that should facilitate the choice of the most appropriate method in different, commonly encountered scenarios. The efficiency of the estimators we introduce and the analysis that we perform should in particular facilitate accurate ab initio calculation of isotope effects in condensed phase systems.},

Examination of the orientational dynamics points to a faster relaxation in the interfacial region. Furthermore, the average value of the dipole decreases and the average value of the highest occupied molecular orbital for each water molecule increases approaching the liquid-vapor interface. Our results support the idea that the surface contains, on average, far more reactive states than the bulk.},

Therefore, applications of DFT to systems where dispersion is important have traditionally been of questionable accuracy. However, the last decade has seen a surge of enthusiasm in the DFT community to tackle this problem and in so-doing to extend the applicability of DFT-based methods. Here we discuss, classify, and evaluate some of the promising schemes to emerge in recent years.

Arguments to support this view are presented, and a semiempirical exchangecorrelation functional containing localspindensity, gradient, and exactexchange terms is tested on 56 atomization energies, 42 ionization potentials, 8 proton affinities, and 10 total atomic energies of first and secondrow systems. This functional performs significantly better than previous functionals with gradient corrections only, and fits experimental atomization energies with an impressively small average absolute deviation of 2.4 kcal/mol.},

Our results indicate that both PBE and BLYP functionals under predict the density and over structure the liquid. Adding the dispersion correction due to Grimme (1, 2) improves the predicted densities for both BLYP and PBE in a significant manner. Moreover, the addition of the dispersion correction for BLYP yields an oxygen-oxygen radial distribution function in excellent agreement with experiment. Thus, we conclude that one can obtain a very satisfactory model for water using BLYP and a correction for dispersion.},

However, in practice the largest outer time step possible is limited not by the physical forces but by resonances between the fast and slow modes. In this paper we show that this problem can be alleviated by using a simple colored noise thermostatting scheme which selectively targets the high frequency modes in the system. For two sample problems, flexible water and solvated alanine dipeptide, we demonstrate that this allows the use of large outer time steps while still obtaining accurate sampling and minimizing the perturbation of the dynamics. Furthermore, this approach is shown to be comparable to constraining fast motions, thus providing an alternative to molecular dynamics with constraints.},

In the case of C8 we find the dynamics to be governed by torsional motions. For C16 and C24 we extract three global order parameters with which we characterize the fundamental dynamics, and determine that the low free-energy pathway of globular collapse proceeds by a "kink and slide" mechanism, whereby a bend near the end of the linear chain migrates toward the middle to form a hairpin and, ultimately, a coiled helix. The low-dimensional representation is subtly perturbed in the solvated phase relative to the ideal gas, and its geometric structure is conserved between C16 and C24. The methodology is directly extensible to biomolecular self-assembly processes, such as protein folding.},

We utilize a flexible, single point charge empirical force field to model the system's interactions. The calculated momentum distributions depict both agreement and discrepancies with experiment. The differences may be explained by the deviation of the force field from the true interactions. These distributions provide an abundance of information about the environment and interactions surrounding the proton.},

abstract = {The diffusion of protons through water is understood within the framework of the Grotthuss mechanism, which requires that they undergo structural diffusion in a stepwise manner throughout the water network. Despite long study, this picture oversimplifies and neglects the complexity of the supramolecular structure of water. We use first-principles simulations and demonstrate that the currently accepted picture of proton diffusion is in need of revision. We show that proton and hydroxide diffusion occurs through periods of intense activity involving concerted proton hopping followed by periods of rest. The picture that emerges is that proton transfer is a multiscale and multidynamical process involving a broader distribution of pathways and timescales than currently assumed. To rationalize these phenomena, we look at the 3D water network as a distribution of closed directed rings, which reveals the presence of medium-range directional correlations in the liquid. One of the natural consequences of this feature is that both the hydronium and hydroxide ion are decorated with proton wires. These wires serve as conduits for long proton jumps over several hydrogen bonds.},

For processes driven by thermal equilibrium noise, the fluctuation-dissipation relation holds. In consequence, the system has to be described by a generalized (integro-differential) Langevin equation with a restriction on the damping integral kernel: Its form depends on the correlation function of noise. For processes driven by nonequilibrium noise, there is no such a restriction: They are considered to be described by stochastic differential (Ito- or Langevin-type) equations with an independent noise term. For the latter, we review methods of analysis of one-dimensional systems driven by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise.},

The silane molecule (SiH4) is adsorbed on to the surface at a number of different sites (on dimer, interrow, or intrarow) with varying barrier heights. Two distinct structures, which are similar in energy, arise from the initial dissociative reaction SiH4-->SiH3(silyl) + H, where the dissociated species are adsorbed either on the same dimer components or on adjacent dimer components. Several further decays of silyl from SiH4 are presented in two separate regimes of high and low ambient hydrogen coverages. The decomposition of silyl can form two different bridging structures: an on top or an intrarow bridging structure in both of the two hydrogen coverage regimes. The disilane molecule (Si2H6) is also adsorbed upon this surface with varying energy barriers, resulting in a dissociation reaction where two SiH3 species are adsorbed on one dimer or in an adjacent dimer configuration. Plausible energy reaction paths for the above models are presented. The stability of the SiH2 species is also discussed.},

The apparatus is described, and the expansion coefficients as a function of temperature are shown graphically together with those of previous workers. Smoothed values of the volume expansion coefficients \{$\beta$\}, and values of the Gr\{\"{u}\}neisen parameter \{$\gamma$\}, calculated from \{$\beta$\} using recent experimental elasticity and specific heat data, are tabulated. For all except LiF, the values of \{$\gamma$\} show a marked decrease towards low temperatures in qualitative agreement with simple point-charge ion models. For LiF, however, \{$\gamma$\} appears to be constant (= 1.60) to within 3\% over the whole temperature range.},

abstract = {The structure, dynamical, and electronic properties of liquid water utilizing different hybrid density functionals were tested within the plane wave framework of first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. The computational approach, which employs modified functionals with short-ranged Hartree-Fock exchange, was first tested in calculations of the structural and bonding properties of the water dimer and cyclic water trimer. Liquid water simulations were performed at the state point of 350 K at the experimental density. Simulations included three different hybrid functionals, a meta-functional, four gradient-corrected functionals, and the local density and Hartree-Fock approximations. It is found that hybrid functionals are superior in reproducing the experimental structure and dynamical properties as measured by the radial distribution function and self-diffusion constant when compared to the pure density functionals. The local density and Hartree-Fock approximations show strongly over- and understructured liquids, respectively. Hydrogen bond analysis shows that the hybrid functionals give slightly smaller average numbers of hydrogen bonds than pure density functionals but similar hydrogen bond populations. The average molecular dipole moments in the liquid from the three hybrid functionals are lower than those of the corresponding pure density functionals.},

We then give an example of how our results can be used, specifically to assess the feasibility of high-order path integral methods. We demonstrate that the most promising of these techniques - which is based on re-weighted sampling - is bound to fail as the size of the system is increased, because of the exponential growth of the statistical uncertainty in the re-weighted average.},

The energy decomposition analyses indicate that all density functionals considered significantly overestimate the contributions of charge transfer to the interaction energies. Moreover, in contrast to some studies that state that density functional theory (DFT) does not include dispersion interactions, we adopt a broader definition and conclude that for (H(2)O)(6) the short-range dispersion interactions recovered in the DFT calculations account about 75\% or more of the net (short-range plus long-range) dispersion energies obtained from the SAPT calculations.},

For periodic time series, the Fourier transform method is preferred because it gives smaller uncertainties that are uniform through all time lags. Based on these analytical results, a statistically robust method has been proposed to test the existence of correlations in a time series. The statistical test is verified by computer simulations and an application to single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy is discussed.},

However, in practice, the largest outer time step possible is limited not by the physical forces but by resonances between the fast and slow modes. In this paper we show that this problem can be alleviated by using a simple colored noise thermostatting scheme which selectively targets the high frequency modes in the system. For two sample problems, flexible water and solvated alanine dipeptide, we demonstrate that this allows the use of large outer time steps while still obtaining accurate sampling and minimizing the perturbation of the dynamics. Furthermore, this approach is shown to be comparable to constraining fast motions, thus providing an alternative to molecular dynamics with constraints.},

@article{rami-herr10jcp,
abstract = {The isotope effect in the melting temperature of ice Ih has been studied by free energy calculations within the path integral formulation of statistical mechanics. Free energy differences between isotopes are related to the dependence of their kinetic energy on the isotope mass. The water simulations were performed by using the q-TIP4P/F model, a point charge empirical potential that includes molecular flexibility and anharmonicity in the OH stretch of the water molecule. The reported melting temperature at ambient pressure of this model (T=251 K) increases by 6.5±0.5 and 8.2±0.5 K upon isotopic substitution of hydrogen by deuterium and tritium, respectively. These temperature shifts are larger than the experimental ones (3.8 and 4.5 K, respectively). In the classical limit, the melting temperature is nearly the same as that for tritiated ice. This unexpected behavior is rationalized by the coupling between intermolecular interactions and molecular flexibility. This coupling makes the kinetic energy of the OH stretching modes larger in the liquid than in the solid phase. However, the opposite behavior is found for intramolecular modes, which display larger kinetic energy in ice than in liquid water.},
